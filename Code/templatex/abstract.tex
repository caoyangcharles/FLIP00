    With the rise of e-sports games, data analysis plays an increasingly important role. 
    PUBG has taken the world by storm with its diverse playability. As a shooting game, players can move, supply, 
    and shoot in the map to obtain higher terms. This paper uses different models to predict the final ranking based on different game data. 
    Finally, the linear regression model was used to obtain 0.015303007019988265 test MSE.
